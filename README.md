- **Multi-file document upload**: Upload multiple client PDFs and product documentation PDFs for comprehensive analysis
- **Intelligent requirement matching**: Accurately matches client requirements with product documentation
- **Visual representation**: Clear, intuitive visualizations of requirement compliance status
- **Automated error detection**: Identifies unmet or partially met requirements
- **Comprehensive reporting**: Generates detailed PDF reports for documentation and sharing
- **AI enhancement**: Optional AI-powered analysis when API keys are available

## Quick Start

1. Open the application (deployed on Replit or installed locally)
2. Upload client requirement PDFs
3. Upload product documentation PDFs
4. Click "Analyze Requirements"
5. Review the analysis results
6. Download the detailed PDF report

## System Requirements

- The application works best with Python 3.10 or 3.11
- For Python 3.13+, see the installation guide for special instructions
- See [Installation Guide](installation_guide.md) for detailed installation instructions

## Usage Examples

### Typical Workflow

1. **Upload Documents**: Upload client requirements and product documentation PDFs
2. **Analyze**: Click the "Analyze Requirements" button
3. **Review Results**: See visual summaries and requirement categorization
4. **Check Details**: Expand individual requirements for detailed analysis
5. **Generate Report**: Create and download a PDF report of findings

### Use Cases

- **Product Compliance**: Verify if a product meets client requirements
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing or partially implemented features
- **Documentation Verification**: Ensure product documentation addresses all client requirements
